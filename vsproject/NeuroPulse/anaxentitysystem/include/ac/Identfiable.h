/********************************************************************************
 * HOW TO USE
 * ==========
 *
 * In order to identify an object, you must include a macro INSIDE the class. It
 * is reccomended to put it at the top of the class, before any declarations.
 *
 * This macro simply adds a Class to the class and a couple of methods. There
 * are different types of macros and they will be discussed. This is for POLYMORPHIC
 * CLASSES ONLY.
 *
 * MACROS:
 * -------
 *
 * AC_IDENTIFIABLE_BASE(classtype)
 *		This macro is used to mark base classes as identifiable.
 *
 * AC_IDENTIFIABLE(classtype)
 *		Marks a class as identifiable that inherits from a base class, publicly.
 *
 *
 * \note
 * This is aimed for single PUBLIC inheritance, no exceptions. If you want to adjust this
 * so it works for multiple inheritance, go ahead. I'm not stopping you.
 *
 * Here is an example:
 * \code
 *
 * class Example
 * {
 *		AC_IDENTIFIABLE_BASE(Example)
 * };
 *
 * \endcode
